9.1 browser
A call to the function browser causes R to halt execution at that point and to provide the user with a special prompt. Arguments to browser are ignored.

> foo <- function(s) {
+ c <- 3
+ browser()
+ }
> foo(4)
Called from: foo(4)
Browse[1]> s
[1] 4
Browse[1]> get("c")
[1] 3
Browse[1]>

9.2 debug/undebug
The debugger can be invoked on any function by using the command debug(fun). Subsequently, each time that function is evaluated the debugger is invoked. The debugger allows you to control the evaluation of the statements in the body of the function. Before each statement is executed the statement is printed out and a special prompt provided. Any command can be given, those in the table above have special meaning.

Debugging is turned off by a call to undebug with the function as an argument.

> debug(mean.default)
> mean(1:10)
debugging in: mean.default(1:10)
debug: {
    if (na.rm)
        x <- x[!is.na(x)]
    trim <- trim[1]
    n <- length(c(x, recursive = TRUE))
    if (trim > 0) {
        if (trim >= 0.5)
            return(median(x, na.rm = FALSE))
        lo <- floor(n * trim) + 1
        hi <- n + 1 - lo
        x <- sort(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))[lo:hi]
        n <- hi - lo + 1
    }
    sum(x)/n
}

debug: trim <- trim[1]
Browse[1]>
debug: n <- length(c(x, recursive = TRUE))
Browse[1]> c

9.3 trace/untrace
Another way of monitoring the behaviour of R is through the trace mechanism. trace is called with a single argument that is the name of the function you want to trace. The name does not need to be quoted but for some functions you will need to quote the name in order to avoid a syntax error.

When trace has been invoked on a function then every time that function is evaluated the call to it is printed out. This mechanism is removed by calling untrace with the function as an argument.

> trace("[<-")
> x <- 1:10
> x[3] <- 4
trace: "[<-"(*tmp*, 3, value = 4)
